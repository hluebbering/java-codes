## Linear Structures. Stacks and Queues

### Definition

With most data structures, adding and removing values causes the system to grow or shrink. However, linear structures change shapes in a planned way: they release points according to how they added them. 

### Interface

Linear structures abide by a simple interface:


```java
public interface Linear<E> extends Structure<E>{
  
  // value is non-null
  // value is added to the collection
  // the consistent replacement policy is not specified
  public void add(E value);
  
  // structure is not empty
  // returns reference to next object to be removed
  public E get();
  
  // structure is not empty
  // removes an object from store
  public E remove();
  
  // returns number of elements in structure
  public int size();
  
  // returns true iff the linear structure is empty
  public boolean empty();
  
}

```


The add and remove methods are used to: 

<span class="lp8">i.</span> insert new values into the linear structure

<span class="lp8">ii.</span> remove those same values later 


\ 


### Types of Linear Structures:

In the following, we discuss two different linear structures:

<div class="b1">

<span class="sp9">I.</span> Stacks: an ordered collection of items with the behavior that the last item in is the first item out.

<span class="sp9">II.</span> Queues: an ordered collection of elements with, unlike a stack, the first item in is the first item out. 

</div>

\ 

--------------------------------------------------------

## Stacks

### Definition

A stack is a collection of items following the behavior that the newest inputted value is the first item to be removed. 

#### Methods

<div class="b1">

<span class="lp9">i.</span> The add method pushes an item onto the stack, while remove pops off the item that was pushed on most recently. 

<span class="lp9">ii.</span> methods *push* and *pop* are alternatives for add and remove, respectively 


```{r, out.width=300, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/css/stack.png")
```



</div>

\ 

#### Interface

Here is the interface that defines what it means to be a Stack:

```java
public interface Stack<E> extends Linear<E>{
  
  // item is added to stack 
  // will be popped next if no intervening push
  public void add(E value);
  
  // item is added to stack
  // will be popped next if no intervening push
  public void push(E value);
  
  // stack is not empty
  // most recent added item is removed and returned
  public E remove();
  
  // stack is not empty
  // most recent pushed item is removed and returned
  public E pop();
  
  // stack is not empty
  // top value (next to be popped) is returned 
  public E getFirst();
  
  // stack is not empty
  // top value (next to be popped) is returned 
  public E get();
  
  // stack is not empty
  // top value (next to be popped) is returned 
  public E peek();
  
  // returns true iff the stack is empty
  public boolean empty();
  
  // returns the number of elements in the stack
  public int size();
  
}
```




\ 



------------------------------------


## Queues

### Definition

A Queue is an ordered collection of elements with tightly controlled access. Unlike the stack, the initial value entered first is the first item to be deleted. 


#### Methods

<div class="b1">

The primary operations of queues are to enqueue and dequeue elements. 

<span class="lp9">i.</span> The program adds elements to the rear; the data points then pass through the structure, eventually reaching the head, where the program removes these data points.


<span class="lp9">ii.</span> To support the linear interface, we supply the alternatives methods: add and remove



```{r, out.width=300, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="As elements are added (enqueued), the Queue expands the Vector; as elements are removed, the leftmost element is removed, shrinking the Vector.", eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/css/queue.png")
```



</div>

\ 

#### Interface

The interface provides a number of other features we have seen already:

```java
public interface Queue<E> extends Linear<E>{
  
  // value is added to the tail of the structure
  public void add(E value);
  
  // value is added to the tail of the structure 
  public void enqueue(E value);
  
  // queue is not empty
  // head of the queue is removed and returned
  public E remove();
  
  // queue is not empty
  // head of the queue is removed and returned
  public E dequeue();
  
  // queue is not empty
  // element at the head of the queue is returned
  public E getFirst();
  
  // queue is not empty
  // element at the head of the queue is returned
  public E get();
  
  // queue is not empty
  // the element at the head of the queue is returned
  public E peek();
  
  // returns true iff the queue is empty
  public boolean empty();
  
  // returns the number of elements in the queue
  public int size();
  
}
```

## Summary

### Operations

The linear structures Stack and Queue each implement add and remove operations. 
<span class="lp9">a.</span> Typical implementations of Stacks refer to these operations as "push" and "pop"

<span class="lp9">b.</span> Typical implementations of Queue methods refer to these operations as "enqueue" and "dequeue"


#### Linear Interface

<span class="lp9">i.</span> These structures solve similar search problems; accordingly, they share a comparable linear interface.

<span class="lp9">ii.</span> a common interface allows us to freely swap implementations
